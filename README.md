# Welcome to the Cosecha Dev Village

This is the official GitHub organization for Movimiento Cosecha. The dev village at Cosecha is made of developers and designers that help all the other teams (circles or villages) in the organization work better. All of the technology that we develop is created as open source projects by volunteers and housed in the [Cosecha GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cosecha).

## Quick Start

Don't want to read much more and just hop in? [Take on one of these newbie friendly issues here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3ACosecha+label%3Anewbie-friendly+label%3Astatus-approved) and leave a comment on the issue saying that you are going to tackle it. If you see an issue that doesn't have enough context for you to get to work on it, leave a comment asking us to explain more, and one of us will be sure to flesh it out! Once you have a fix, [open a pull request](README.md#how-to-contribute).

## How we work

We organize around [projects on Github](https://github.com/Cosecha). Subteams of the dev team are therefore just project Circles. So, for example, if you want to be a part of the website circle, just head over to [the website repository](https://github.com/Cosecha/cosecha.github.io) and start working there! If you want to know what all the available projects are to work on, [take a look at our main projects page](https://github.com/Cosecha).

Whenever we have a new feature we want to implement or a bug we want to fix, we create an issue in the corresponding Github repository and discuss the issue there. We use labels on Github issues to track work. The labels we use across all our projects are:

* newbie-friendly: Issues that are easy for new people to start working on
* priority-high: High priority issues
* status-approved: Issues that have been approved and should be worked on!  Anything else is a new issue that has yet to be triaged.

There may be other labels depending on the complexity of the project, but all projects should have these labels.

## How to contribute

## Our technology stack

Cosecha main site is currently an HTML site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Cosecha/cosecha.github.io). The Cosecha Plaza is a deployment of Rocket.Chat, an open source [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com) app. We also use [Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) as our CRM for emails, landing pages, and fundraising pages.

All of Cosecha's data exists in our Action Network CRM. As a result, tools we use will often need to interface with Action Network to get relevant data back into that system. Outside of Action Network, we're open to different tech stacks, but we generally use JavaScript and deploy our projects to Digital Ocean.

## Design projects

We want to use Github to organize design projects as well, but we need designers interested in creating a Designer Village or Circle (team). If you are interested drop by our forum ([Cosecha Plaza](http://laplaza.movimientocosecha.com/channel/cosecha)) and show us some of your work!

## How to propose and hear about new projects

For projects that have no code yet, the relevant issues are on this repo! So if you think we should be working on something that we're not, [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/Cosecha/Welcome/issues). If you want to hear about new projects we decided to work on, [watch this repo](https://github.com/Cosecha/Welcome/subscription).

## How our team is structured

Right now, we have a core team of developers (something like the Meteor Development Group for Meteor or the core team on most open source projects) who are responsible for:

* coming up with the tech plan
* triaging issues every week
* keeping up with the work that all the other teams are doing
* taking on urgent work that comes up
* onboarding new developers
* and being responsible for the maintenance and improvement of specific projects in this organization.

We'd like to grow this core team, but we also want to make it possible to be effective even if you cannot commit so much time or take on so much responsibility. So we want everyone who wants to get involved to do so by jumping into our issues, getting a sense of what we're working on, and committing some code! If you are able to put in some work, feel you have a bit of time to commit, and want to take on more responsibility, let one of the current core team members know in the [Plaza](http://laplaza.movimientocosecha.com/channel/cosecha) and we'd love to have you on board! The current people on the core team are:

1. @celsom3
2. @DynamicMetaFlow

## Questions? Comments? Problems?

If you think we need to add anything else to this README, open a pull request! If you have a question about a project, comment on an existing issue or create a new issue on this repository!  If you had any trouble with this process, open an issue on this repository as well! And if you just want to say hi or have any general questions, join us on [Plaza](http://laplaza.movimientocosecha.com/channel/cosecha)!
